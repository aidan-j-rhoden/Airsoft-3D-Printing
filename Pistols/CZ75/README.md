# Magazine holster
The [CZ75](https://www.evike.com/products/42999/) is an awesome cheap springer pistol, but you need more mags.  Then, you need something to hold those mags.

## Build Instructions
The clip is printed with supports.  I tried to print 3 clips at once, but two of the three shrunk off the buildplate. 
The box is not printed with supports.

### Materiels Used/Tested:
ESUN PLA++ (tested white only, presumably any other color would still work.)
* Extruder temp: 200C
* Bed temp: 60C
* 100% infill
* Cooling fan optional
