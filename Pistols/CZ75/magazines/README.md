# Magazine holster
The [CZ75](https://www.evike.com/products/42999/) is an awesome cheap springer pistol, but you need more mags.  Then, you need something to hold those mags.

## Build Instructions
The clip is printed with supports.  I tried to print 3 clips at once, but two of the three shrunk off the buildplate.
The box is not printed with supports.

After both parts are printed, use superglue to do the rest.

### Materiels Used/Tested:
ESUN PLA++, SUNLU PLA+, Protopasta Recycled PLA
* Extruder temp: 200C
* Bed temp: 55C
* 100% infill for the clip, whatever you want for the box
* Cooling fan recomended
