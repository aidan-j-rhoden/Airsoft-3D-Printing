# Barrel Shroud/Guard
For protecting an extended inner barrel.  This simply slides over the end of the outer barrel of a [Snow Wolf M24](https://www.evike.com/products/33422/).
You can, of course, scale this for any other project.  Some electrical tape may be required.

## Build Instructions
The capped-off end is printed down.  No supports or adhesion beds are used.

### Materiels Used/Tested:
ESUN PLA++ (tested white only, presumably any other color would still work.)
* Extruder temp: 215C
* Bed temp: 60C
* 20% - 100% infill
* Cooling optional

Overture PETG Black
* Extruder temp: 215C
* Bed temp: 75C
* 20% - 100% infill
* No cooling
* This stuff strings pretty bad, as the flow control wasn't so great for me.  I would recomend using a PLA.

Protopasta Recycled PLA (tested black only, presumably any other color would still work.)
* Extruder temp: 215C
* Bed temp: 60C
* 20% - 100% infill
* Cooling fan 80%
