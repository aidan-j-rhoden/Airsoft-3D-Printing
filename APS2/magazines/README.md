# APS2 Mag Catch
This [magazine](https://evike.com/products) didn't fit in the [Snow Wolf M24](https://www.evike.com/products/33422/) as advertised, so instead of returning it and paying for shipping, I 3D printed a new catch/release piece.

## Build Instructions
Print with supports, except for in the hole on the bottem where the spring goes.  It doesn't really need it, and it's a pain to clean out.  You may have to trim it up anyway, depending on print quality.
Also, the magazine may require some sanding here and there. ;)

### Materiels Used/Tested
* Extruder temp: 215C
* Bed temp: 60C
* Cooling fan: 80%
